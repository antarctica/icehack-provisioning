    "\n",
    "* Based on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty)\n",
    "* Python 2.7 with [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html) and [Iris](http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/index.html)\n",

    "* Jupyter notebook with Python and R kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I use a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments can be used in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the browser using Jupyter notebook\n",
    "2. From the command using through SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environments contain two user accounts, one for writing code `user`, and one for managing the underlying operating system `superuer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The `superuser` account does not have access to Miniconda, local pip packages or R libraries. This account should only be used for installing additional system packages or tweaking system-wide configuration files as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their logins are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *User* account\n",
    "    * Username: `user`\n",
    "    * Password: `icehack`\n",
    "* *Superuser* account\n",
    "    * Username: `superuser`\n",
    "    * Password: `Ahh-a-seal!`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook is the easiest way to interact with the environment and provides support for writing Python and R code and executing it in-browser. This makes showing others really easy, as tools like Matplotlib can display directly within a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to the [Jupyter file browser](/tree)\n",
    "* Choose *New* -> *Python 2* or *R*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run a terminal through the browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to the [Jupyter file browser](/tree)\n",
    "* Choose *New* -> *Terminal*\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of things to bare in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Notebooks and terminals are executed as the `user` user account (which does not have sudo rights)\n",
    "* Terminals use the `/bin/sh` shell\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SSH\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to run code directly through the terminal, or wish to work outside the virtual machine through an IDE for example, you can connect directly to the virtual machine over the standard SSH port, i.e. `22`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I get a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this notebook you are already accessing an instance of this environment through Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hosted environments\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of hosted environments will be available for *Icehack*, and these will be available for a limited period of time after the event as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details of which hosted environment you should use will be given during the main event introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local environments\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run a virtual environment locally follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure you have either VirtualBox (free) or VMware Fusion/Workstation (paid for) installed on your local machine\n",
    "* It is strongly recommended you also install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) to make managing virtual machines easier\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If you are using Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "cd ~ (or somewhere suitable)\n",
    "mkdir icehack\n",
    "vagrant init antarctica/icehack\n",
    "vagrant up\n",
    "vagrant ssh-config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a new virtual machine using the virtual machine image for the Icehack virtual environment.\n",
    "As the VM image needs to be downloaded, the `vagrant up` step may take some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once running, `vagrant ssh-config`, will display the IP address assigned to the virtual environment. You will need this when connecting using SSH, or accessing Jupyter from the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be a good idea to add a hosts file entry for this to make it easier to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If you are not using Vagrant\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual environment is available as a OVA (a compressed virtual machine) which can be used by all major desktop virtualisation products. We specifically support VirtualBox and VMware Fusion/Workstation only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although designed to be interoperable, virtual machine tools (for enabling features such as shared folders) are provider specific. Therefore we provide separate OVA's for each provider. These files are available on external hard drives you can copy from - please ask [someone](#Who's-Here-to-Help) if you need one.\n",
    "\n",
    "OVAs are located in `/environment/ovas/0.3.0/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once copied to your local machine, import the OVA into your virtualisation software, configure and wait for it to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Copying data and other files\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then need to copy the following the directories from an external hard drive (please ask [someone](#Who's-Here-to-Help) for one) to `/home/user/` in the virtual machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/data`\n",
    "* `/examples`\n",
